# One-Dark-Pro-VSCode-Tweaks
Personal tweaks to the One Dark Pro VSCode theme

# Installation
In order to use the tweaks, just paste the contents of the [`settings.json`](https://github.com/LynnKomang/One-Dark-Pro-VSCode-Tweaks/blob/master/settings.json) file into the `settings.json` of VSCode (if there is already `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations` declared in the file, then merge the contents of the file into the existing configuration).

To get to that file: `CTRL+SHIFT+P > Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

# Note
I've left the parameter's colorization as a comment, as I don't think it looks great along with the other colorizations.<br>
If you like the parameter's coloring, just uncomment the block.
